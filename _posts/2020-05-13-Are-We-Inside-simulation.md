As absurd as this question sounds, the more interesting it is. The question that we are the characters of a very advanced computer civilization. Isn’t it awesome? Simulation hypothesis is an idea that the physical world we live in, including the Earth and rest of the world is a computer simulation. You can think of it as a high resolution, first person conscious video game. 

The nature, the Earth, the Universe is governed by a set of mathematical rules, a lot of which we are not even aware of. Moreover, the sub atomicity proves that everything is broken up into pieces just like pixels in video games. From the first video game Pong to today, our computer games have evolved and become more realistic. As the computing power will grow, the quality of games will become more palpable. 

If we can reach such technological advancement to create a simulation so powerful that it is similar to our real world then it would be a very strong proof that we are inside a simulation — a simulation creating a simulation. The chances are that our creator(s) are also part of some other simulation. Infact, it gives a radical alternative to the current model of reality, resulting in an infinite Universe. Each subsequent simulation will be less and less technologically advanced — they just won’t be able to match their creators in advancing technologies.

Wait, but of what use would a simulation be? Just like we use computers to perform all kinds of mathematical calculations, in a similar way our brains perform tons and tons of operation per second. With all the organisms around the Universe, our creator must be drawing lots and lots of power from our Universe. Also, a simulated Universe could be designed for the eventual rise of life, that is experimenting with the components and parameters to make the life of the creator better.

Now you must be wondering how can we confirm if we are in a simulation? How many times have you witnessed a miracle or coincidence? This might be a glitch in the computer program we are living in. Softwares get bugs and updates all the time which are often rolled out in our world.

Nevertheless, there is a lot we need to discover and a lot we need to understand before we reach a point where we can model the universe of our own and unleash the truth. This discovery will give rise to a myriad of questions or it might make things simpler, just like when Corpenicus realised Earth was not the center of the Universe. Afterall, it is still a mystery if we are even real.
