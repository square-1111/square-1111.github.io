It is not just another cycling event but the most prestigious which attracts the world’s best riders. Around 20 teams with eight riders each, the bikers cycle through the steep climbs of the Alps and the Pyrenees to the scorching sun on the flats, from the race against time to the endurance test — Tour de France is the toughest amongst the major sporting events. 

Starting off with an aim to sell more copies of sports newspaper L’Auto in 1903. The editor setup the 2400 Km cycling event in 5 stages over the course of 19 days across the country.  Within 5 years their sales doubled. The saddle point which sparked the interest of the spectator was, in 1910 when the riders were sent, for the first time, to the Tourmalet — the highest paved mountain path with a 19km uphill climb ascending 1400m to the summit. 1919 marked the introduction of the yellow jersey, because L’Auto was published on Yellow paper. This jersey also known as Maillot Jaune is an honor given to the rider with least cumulative time. Three other types of jersey are also awarded during the tour. Green jersey, also known as Maillot Vert is awarded to the best sprinter; Polka Dot jersey to the finest climber and the White Jersey to best-placed rider aged under 26. 

With each rider wearing colors of their national jersey, this colorful combination forms a kaleidoscope of moving color on wheels known as Peloton — which saves energy of the riders at the back. The riders in the front protect the riders at the back by cutting the wind resistance, helping the best team member to  perform better in later parts of the tour. This technique of forming a peloton is known as Drafting. The scenic views of Tour de France might sound picturesque but it is the toughest of all major sporting events. The riders burn up to 7000 calories per day, while ordinarily a person burns 2000 calories per day. Their heartbeats go up to 200 BPM. And god forbid the weather. Cyclists might catch the common cold in the winds, rain, hail and even snow on the mountain. In flats, the blistering heat and the sun cause chronic dehydration and fatigue. If you still feel it's easy, then try to cycle at 300 Watts for 2 km, you might feel the burn. Professionals, on an average generate more than 400 Watts of energy during the tour. Cherry on top, the tour gets a little tougher every year.

In 2020, the event has been postponed due to COVID-19 and will now start on August 29, 2020 at Nice, France and the race will end on 20 September 2020 in Paris. During the 23 days of the event the riders cycle for 21 days while resting for 2 days.The cyclist journeys through more mountains and climbs, making it more dangerous, through the scenic plains to race for the title.

Tour de France isn’t about the strongest rider but one who endures the most pain, physically and mentally,  and ultimately has what it takes to conquer the mountains.
