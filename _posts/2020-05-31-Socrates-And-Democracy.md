Ancient Greece was not even a cohesive empire, it was made up of many city states, led by Athens and Sparta. Despite its fragmentation, it has made innumerous contributions to civilization. Contribution in Mathematics, Medical Science, Astronomy out of which the most prevalent is in Philosophy. Amongst the famous philosophers was Socrates, who lived in the times when democracy was flourishing in Athens. But he was skeptical about the business of democracy.

His pessimistic behaviour towards unfettered and pure democracy is described in Plato’s sixth book of *The Republic*. Plato dialogued the conversation between Socrates and Adeimantus where Socrates was telling the flaws of democracy by comparing it to a ship. Socrates asked, if you are heading out on a journey in a ship, who would you like to be leading the ship? Just anyone or educated people who fit the role? Adeimantus said the latter of course. In response, Socrates asked why do we keep thinking that any old person should be fit to choose the ruler of the country? 

Socrates pointed out voting in an election is a skill, not a random intuition. People must be taught about it systematically like any other skill. Socrates suggested just like maneuvering the ship in a storm, selecting a ruler for the country requires expertise. He was never against the idea everyone should vote. Instead he was worried if the people are educated enough to make this type of decision? Maybe they can be manipulated by the demagogue. 

Socrates knew how easy, people running for election could exploit our desires for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an election between two candidates, one similar to a sweet shop owner and other similar to a doctor. Candidate similar to a sweetshop owner says about his rival, he gives you injection, asks you to eat bitter medicines and tells you to eat and drink, but I will give you sweets and candies and ice creams. In response, the doctor did not have much to say but wanted to help the society. This caused an uproar amongst the voters. Ever Since, we have elected many sweet shop owners and very few doctors.

Socrates insisted that only people who think rationally and deeply about the issues should be allowed to vote. But as President Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as “Government of the people, by the people, for the people” are we electing more sweet shop owners or a ruler who wants to make the world a better place. Is it democracy or demagoguery?
