I have grown up in a middle-class Hindu family, my pre-teen afternoons during summer vacations were spent learning multiplication tables, eating mangoes, playing Ludo and enjoying the myths in my mother's lap — legends of Lord Ganesha, Goddess Parvati; stories from Ramayana and Mahabharat. I barely remember any of those. 

Days aren't the same, but today was different. Just like any other day in quarantine, I was on desk fiddling around with the laptop, mom was scrolling through her WhatsApp. It was not at all odd that she gets all kinds of audio forwards. But today it was, someone was narrating the myths of Lord Ganesha — an anecdote about why every Puja starts with Lord Ganesha’s name.

Long long ago, while Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi’s marriage, Lord Ganesha was left in-charge to guard Swargalok. He was tricked to do so because other deities were embarrassed of his physical appearance and his massive diet. The procession went on, when Narad Ji saw Lord Ganesha at the door of Swargalok and asked the reason. Withered Lord Ganesha told his sorrow to Narad Muni. On knowing this Narad suggested Lord Ganesha avenge his respect and devised a plan that would make deities realise Lord Ganesha’s importance. 

Lord Ganesha asked his Mushakraj to dig up the roads that lead to Goddess Lakshmi’s abode. Mushakraj followed the orders and bore the roads. As expected, the deities couldn’t proceed further, the wheels of their chariot got stuck in the earth. Everyone took their measures but the wheel did not move. No one could understand what was going around. A farmer, passing by, decided to help them. The farmer chanted Lord Ganesha’s name and pulled out the carriage. 

Farmer, being asked by deities, explained that Lord Ganesha’s name has induced strength in him since he is the Remover of Obstacles. Deities realised that there is more to a being than his physical appearance, and they returned to apologize to Lord Ganesha.   

This story tells us to Always stand up for your self-respect. I exchanged smiles, cut a mango and recalled those old days.
