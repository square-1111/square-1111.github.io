A group of 6 reckless adults at The Central Perk Cafe, New York making their life happening and troublesome, this is how it all started. I have been a fan ever since and have binged it an infinite number of times. From the obsessive-compulsive nature of Monica, dim-witted yet caring nature of Joey, Rachel being self centered but always trying to be a good friend, Phoebe being gaga with child's heart , Ross being clumsy with intelligence and Chandler good with numbers, socially awkward but extremely sarcastic, they all harmonized in a perfect symphony to make me learn life lesson. Everytime I feel happy, sad, fearful, disgusting, angry or surprised I watch FRIENDS, which means I watch it all the time. Each character has taught me something and I would like to share that:

**Monica** : A cleanliness freak — “I know” — who glued the group as family. She is the mother of the group and like some mothers, she can be domineering and overbearing. Why not? She taught us that it's alright to let people down just to be yourself. Her habit of orderliness and planning tells us that always having a plan is the best way to live your life. And most important thing, food is truly the best thing in the world.

**Ross** : “Hi” — I might kill myself. With a doctorate degree and three divorces, Ross has taught us about UNAGI. In all seriousness, Ross has been a caring, polite and kind person. He was always there to help when something is morally wrong. His intelligence and nerd weirdness never stops him from forming valuable relationships. He proves that brainsy is the new sexy. 

**Chandler** : Hands down, Chandler has evolved the most, from being the most vulnerable to his endless love towards Monica taught us to love. His never ending witty remarks and socially awkward puns he told us the best thing you can give someone is a good laugh. He has one liners for every situation and he knows how to diffuse tension in the room.  

**Phoebe** : “Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you” —  I believe you must have sung it. She is my favorite character because of her freaky and weird childlike spirit. Her oddly realistic guitar session has been like a therapy to me. Her bizarre pseudo-scientific theory to explain actually got me.

**Rachel** : From leaving his fiance and being a spoiled brat to being offered a position at Louis Vuitton in Paris, Rachel taught that it is never too late. Her role as waitress narrates, sometimes you have to settle for a job you dislike. She delivered that materialism isn’t the key to happiness but being sassy can make you feel good. Also, she taught us that true love can withstand a lot.

**Joey** : “How you doin’..?” — Joey is a good natured person but not so bright. He loves food and sex — “I you had to, what would you give up, food or sex? I want girls on bread”. His dim-witted nature made him very optimistic and appreciate his talents. He taught us to have confidence in yourself even when no one else does.  


It's not just comedy, it feels like I am part of the group everytime I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through.
