        <title>Day 003, Are we inside simulation?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As absurd as this question sounds, the more interesting it is. The question that we are the characters of a very advanced computer civilization. Isn’t it awesome? Simulation hypothesis is an idea that the physical world we live in, including the Earth and rest of the world is a computer simulation. You can think of it as a high resolution, first person conscious video game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature, the Earth, the Universe is governed by a set of mathematical rules, a lot of which we are not even aware of. Moreover, the sub atomicity proves that everything is broken up into pieces just like pixels in video games. From the first video game Pong to today, our computer games have evolved and become more realistic. As the computing power will grow, the quality of games will become more palpable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can reach such technological advancement to create a simulation so powerful that it is similar to our real world then it would be a very strong proof that we are inside a simulation — a simulation creating a simulation. The chances are that our creator(s) are also part of some other simulation. Infact, it gives a radical alternative to the current model of reality, resulting in an infinite Universe. Each subsequent simulation will be less and less technologically advanced — they just won’t be able to match their creators in advancing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, but of what use would a simulation be? Just like we use computers to perform all kinds of mathematical calculations, in a similar way our brains perform tons and tons of operation per second. With all the organisms around the Universe, our creator must be drawing lots and lots of power from our Universe. Also, a simulated Universe could be designed for the eventual rise of life, that is experimenting with the components and parameters to make the life of the creator better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you must be wondering how can we confirm if we are in a simulation? How many times have you witnessed a miracle or coincidence? This might be a glitch in the computer program we are living in. Softwares get bugs and updates all the time which are often rolled out in our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there is a lot we need to discover and a lot we need to understand before we reach a point where we can model the universe of our own and unleash the truth. This discovery will give rise to a myriad of questions or it might make things simpler, just like when Corpenicus realised Earth was not the center of the Universe. Afterall, it is still a mystery if we are even real.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 002, Rubik's Cube</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“What’s that red, blue, yellow twisty toy am I fidgeting with? Rubik’s Cube? Those who know me know how gaga I am for Rubik’s Cube.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did Hungarian Professor Erno Rubik know when he invented rubik’s cube from wooden blocks and paper clips that his invention would be so popular. It’s been a long time since I was first gifted with a Rubik’s Cube. My father gifted me one he bought from the Aligarh Exhibition when I was 12 or 13 years old. Like many school going kids I was enamored by the Rubik’s Cube but could barely even solve 1 layer. One day, in frustration, I broke the cube but later that day I joined those pieces together and that’s how I solved the cube for the first time but never touched it again. Up until freshman year at college where I bought a decent cube and again, I started the quest to figure out 1 of the 43 quintillion total possibilities without any help. Baffled, I was on the verge to break the cube when a cousin of mine told me the algorithm to solve it. Delhi wasn’t far, I learned to solve the cube in 2 days and within a week I memorized the basic algorithm and was able to solve it in less than 3 minutes. After a month of practice, my average speed was about a minute or so but I wasn’t satisfied by the algorithm and started to look for a faster alternative for speed cubing. I started to watch youtube tutorials endlessly and over some time my speed gradually improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was learning gradually, I wanted to feed my curiosity to solve different types of Rubik’s Cube. The 5X5X5 and Mirror cube were very similar to 3X3X3 where the centerpiece is directly connected to the scaffold which means the center won’t move. But in 4X4X4, also known as Rubik’s Revenge, there are no fixed centerpiece, this makes it more tricky. Axis Cube is a mod of 3X3X3 cube with unequal divisions, which means a scrambled Axis Cube won’t be cubical in shape. The main hustle with Axis Cube is to figure out center, edge and corner parts. And then comes Megaminx, a dodecahedron based puzzle similar to Rubik’s Cube with 50 separate pieces and 12 different colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rubiksCube.jpg&quot; height=&quot;80%&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I learned about it, the more I wanted to know about it. All the algorithms slowly became trivial when I started understanding the mathematics of Rubik’s Cube. I am always fascinated by how many secrets Rubik’s cube holds. Out of all these the most interesting is the God’s number which tells the maximum number of steps required to solve a Rubik’s Cube is 20 despite the configuration. It is called so because you have to be some kind of omniscient to figure out these moves. Out of 43 quintillion possibilities only 490 million (1.14*10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; %) requires a maximum of 20 moves to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, Rubiks Cube has added lots of positivity in my life. Sometimes, this simplistic yet complex toy acts as a de-stresser, providing a distraction from life. Other times, it challenges me to draw out more secrets. But it always satisfies my inner self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;Next time you see a Rubik's Cube, grab it and try solving it. It's fun, it's meditative, it's amazing.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 001, What I learnt from characters of F.R.I.E.N.D.S</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank You &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IramMahe&quot;&gt;Mahe&lt;/a&gt; for the edits.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I know what you thinking; “Oh, not another FRIENDS fan!!!” But who cares what you think? I am a F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan and I am going to write about it.  I have been a fan ever since I first watched these 6 reckless adults trying to make the best out of their beautifully troublesome and oh-so-happening life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obsessive-compulsive natured Monica, dim-witted yet caring Joey, Rachel: self centered but always trying to be a good friend, Phoebe-the gaga with a child’s heart, clumsy but intelligent Ross, and of course Chandler, the socially awkward king of sarcasm; I wanted to be friends with each one of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their starkly different natures all harmonized in a perfect symphony. I binge watch F.R.I.E.N.D.S on a daily basis. 
I feel happy, I watch FRIENDS. I am sad, I watch FRIENDS.  I am fearful, disgusted, angry or surprised I watch FRIENDS. I watch FRIENDS all the time. 
Today I ended up pondering  what each character of FRIENDS taught me. 
This is what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ross&lt;/strong&gt; : “Hi” — I might kill myself. With a doctorate degree and three divorces, Ross taught me UNAGI * does the touching-forehead-with-index-finger action *. In all seriousness, Ross has been a caring, polite and a kind person. He was always there to help when something went wrong. His intelligence and nerd weirdness never stops him from forming valuable relationships. Ross proved that brainy is the new sexy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monica&lt;/strong&gt; : A cleanliness freak — “I know” —  glued the entire group as family. I think she is the mother of the group and like mothers sometimes are,  she can be domineering and overbearing. Why not? She taught us that it’s alright to let people down just to be yourself. Her habit of orderliness and planning tells us that always having a plan is the best way to live your life(well, it’s nice to think so). And the most important thing; food is truly the best thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chandler&lt;/strong&gt; : Hands down, Chandler has evolved the most, from being the most vulnerable to his endless love towards Monica, Chandler taught us how to love. Through his never ending witty remarks and socially awkward puns he told us the best thing you can give someone is a good laugh. The guy has one liners for every damned situation and he knows how to diffuse tension in the room. I try to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rachel&lt;/strong&gt; : From leaving her fiancé and being a spoiled brat to being offered a position at Louis Vuitton in Paris, Rachel taught me that it is never too late. Her role as waitress narrates that sometimes one has to settle for a job one dislikes. Rachel’s character delivered that materialism isn’t the key to happiness but being sassy can make you feel good. Most importantly, she taught me that true love can withstand a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoebe&lt;/strong&gt; : “Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you” — I believe you must have sung it. She is by far my most favorite character because of her freaky and weird childlike spirit. Her oddly realistic guitar sessions have been a therapy for me. Her bizarre pseudo-scientific theory to explain actually got me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joey&lt;/strong&gt; : “How you doin’..?” — Joey is good natured  but not so bright. He loves food and sex — “If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex? I want girls on bread”. Haha. Even thinking of that scene, I crack up! Was it his dim-witted nature that made him so optimistic and so confident of his talents? I learnt from Joey to  have faith in myself even when no one else did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have felt their heart break and I have rejoiced in their joy.
I have cried with them. I have sat on that orange couch and have laughed with them.&lt;br /&gt;
These 6 weirdos are not just characters for me, they are my own best friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>#100 days of Writing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the next 100 days and more I will write 500 words daily about interesting, funny, random, weird things. I am starting this to improve my writing skills and more importantly to think clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/What-i-learnt-from-friends/&quot;&gt;What I learnt from characters of F.R.I.E.N.D.S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
