        <title>Day 017, P versus NP</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Programmers in the early days of computing started to solve problems using their cabinet size computers. Just like every solution initially, it used to be slow and then improved iteratively. But for some problems they cannot figure out a faster solution while a variety of problems have been proved to have no faster solution, like predicting the optimal move in chess. In order to handle the situation, researchers started sorting programs on how fast the program can solve the problem. Multiplication, Sorting have a faster program while for chess there is no faster program. But there were some problems which couldn’t be determined in which bucket they fell — finding prime numbers, travelling-salesman problem etc. This is where P and NP come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how to figure out that the program is fast in general? Computer Scientists calculate the time for each step and add up. The catch is, they don’t answer this in minutes or seconds, instead they calculate it relative to the number of elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P class of problems are those which can be solved in polynomial time, or the set of problems whose solution time is proportional to polynomial. Obviously, an algorithm whose time is proportional to N&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is slower than N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but this is insignificant when compared to another distinction — the complexity of algorithms where a number is raised to the Nth power, like, 2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;. And this discrepancy gets much, much worse as N grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NP — Nondeterministic Polynomial time — is a problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time. But many of these problems take exponential times to get solved. So what’s the deal with P equal NP? It means if the solution to a problem can be verified in polynomial time, can it be found in polynomial time? Frequently called the most important problem in the computer science domain, P vs NP is one of the 7 problems for which the Clay Mathematics Institute will give you million dollars to (dis)prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you ponder? There is no specific problem but there are multiple problems in this class. What does that mean? In early 70’s complexity researchers realised that a dozen NP problems they were struggling with are essentially the same but with some polynomial time constraints. You just need to prove one of the problems to make the entire NP set lie inside the P class set. As hard as it is to prove this problem, proving any problem in itself is a NP problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes it so important? 
The excitement to solve this problem is as vivid as the applications it can solve. A lot of the puzzles we are trying to figure out will become easier — the protein folding problem, drug for cancer. We can develop an accurate financial forecasting model,  figure out the optimal arrangement of transistors on a silicon chip and the banking system might collapse as encryptions will become easier to crack.  As &lt;strong&gt;Scott Aaronson&lt;/strong&gt; said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;center&gt;”If P=NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in “creative leaps,” no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it's found. Everyone who could appreciate a symphony would be Mozart; everyone who could follow a step-by-step argument would be Gauss; everyone who could recognize a good investment strategy would be Warren Buffett.“&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 016, Robin: A quintessential Sidekick</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;80 years ago, Robin — the most iconic sidekick, was born. Quirky, witty, comical, bold and badass — this  “Boy Wonder” has risked its life innumerous times while entertaining us. While Bruce Wayne has worn Batman’s cape, there have been many characters behind Robin’s Mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard John “Dick” Grayson or Robin was debuted in Detective Comics #38, 1940. After the cold-blooded murder of Robin’s parents, by Tony Zucco in order to extort money from the circus that employed them, Robin vowed to take revenge. Witnessing this, Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist by day and vigilante by night, took Robin in and channelized his anger. Batman taught him martial art and trained him as his alter ego to become a crime fighting master. Dick’s successor Jason Todd shared a similar story but due to his negative reception, he was killed, at the hands of Joker, in DC #408 and during the “A death of the Family” storyline. In 2005, he was resurrected as vengeful Red Hood and became a ruthless antihero who clashed with Batman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, Carrie Kelly appeared in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (1986) which made her the most popular Robin till time. In 1989, Tim Drake, a teen with excellent hacking and technical skill, was trained to become Robin. Stephanie Brown, daughter of villainous Cluemaster, became the first female Robin in mainstream DC continuity in Robin no. 126, who later assumed the role of Batgirl. Lastly, Damian Wayne, son of Talia and Batman fitted into the mantle of Robin. Trained by League of Assassin, when Damian met his father he started to fight for the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a colorful attire of red, green and yellow tunic, scaly speedos and pixie boots, Robin was inseparable from Batman forming a dynamic duo.  Moreover, Robin is Batman’s best friend and provided him with a family when no one was there. With endless puns, he lightened the dark theme of the comics.  Dick prevented Batman from going too far and reminded him why he chose to fight. Jason mirrored Batman’s own rage, giving him the glimpse of what could have happened if his principles weren’t crude. Tim mirrored Batman’s need for justice while Stephanie showed him how intense his recklessness is. Damian, his own son, has shown him there is a future to the idea despite how bleak the chances are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robins have left a lasting impression on the audience with its comic sense. As the comics grew, each Robin taught Batman something — becoming a perfect sidekick. The legacy of Robin will continue to expand in a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 015, Tour de France</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not just another cycling event but the most prestigious which attracts the world’s best riders. Around 20 teams with eight riders each, the bikers cycle through the steep climbs of the Alps and the Pyrenees to the scorching sun on the flats, from the race against time to the endurance test — Tour de France is the toughest amongst the major sporting events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting off with an aim to sell more copies of sports newspaper L’Auto in 1903. The editor setup the 2400 Km cycling event in 5 stages over the course of 19 days across the country.  Within 5 years their sales doubled. The saddle point which sparked the interest of the spectator was, in 1910 when the riders were sent, for the first time, to the Tourmalet — the highest paved mountain path with a 19km uphill climb ascending 1400m to the summit. 1919 marked the introduction of the yellow jersey, because L’Auto was published on Yellow paper. This jersey also known as Maillot Jaune is an honor given to the rider with least cumulative time. Three other types of jersey are also awarded during the tour. Green jersey, also known as Maillot Vert is awarded to the best sprinter; Polka Dot jersey to the finest climber and the White Jersey to best-placed rider aged under 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each rider wearing colors of their national jersey, this colorful combination forms a kaleidoscope of moving color on wheels known as Peloton — which saves energy of the riders at the back. The riders in the front protect the riders at the back by cutting the wind resistance, helping the best team member to  perform better in later parts of the tour. This technique of forming a peloton is known as Drafting. The scenic views of Tour de France might sound picturesque but it is the toughest of all major sporting events. The riders burn up to 7000 calories per day, while ordinarily a person burns 2000 calories per day. Their heartbeats go up to 200 BPM. And god forbid the weather. Cyclists might catch the common cold in the winds, rain, hail and even snow on the mountain. In flats, the blistering heat and the sun cause chronic dehydration and fatigue. If you still feel it’s easy, then try to cycle at 300 Watts for 2 km, you might feel the burn. Professionals, on an average generate more than 400 Watts of energy during the tour. Cherry on top, the tour gets a little tougher every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the event has been postponed due to COVID-19 and will now start on August 29, 2020 at Nice, France and the race will end on 20 September 2020 in Paris. During the 23 days of the event the riders cycle for 21 days while resting for 2 days.The cyclist journeys through more mountains and climbs, making it more dangerous, through the scenic plains to race for the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tour de France isn’t about the strongest rider but one who endures the most pain, physically and mentally,  and ultimately has what it takes to conquer the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 014, Cult of Q</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/&quot;&gt;The Prophecies of Q&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;strong&gt;Adrienne LaFrance&lt;/strong&gt;, cover story of The Atlantic, June 2020 edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reddit, 4chan, 8chan: these anonymous platforms, are home to numerous conspiracy theories about untouchable and secretive cabal. One of which is QAnon conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QAnon started as fringe theory online, which believes that the world, especially the US is controlled by a powerful organization called Deep States. According to Q mythology, President Donald Trump was elected by the support of highest military intelligence in this time to deal with the great upheaval. The main idea is that Q society and Trump are fighting Satanic Deep States which includes Hillary Clinton, the Obamas, the Bushes and other elites. These Satanic elites are believed to be sex traffickers who torture children and drink adrenochrome for their magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea originated in October 2016, when Wikileaks publicly released the emails stolen from the account of John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff and chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The emails repeatedly mentioned Comet. These emails were mostly about fundraising but some high profile Trump supporters claimed, on 4chan which later spread to more accessible social media platforms, that these emails are evidence of ritualistic child abuse. This created chaos. Edgar Maddison Welch, on December 4, 2016 arrived at Comet Ping Pong in order to self-investigate the theory — “Pizzagate”. Earlier, these theories were posted by anonymous users, but in October 2017 an anonymous user with username “Q” who claimed to be a government insider posted about the arrest of Hillary Clinton on 4chan, which evidently did not happen. Q wanted to make people believe it is a military official with Q level clearance or a classified intelligence officer. Slowly Q started dropping intel, often incomprehensible, filled with abbreviation, cryptic reference and jargons. QAnon, the followers of Q used these hints to try and decipher the secret that Q was trying to pass. These posts were based on a history of false, baseless and unsubstantiated claims which led to wrong prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bring order to the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cultish devotion of QAnon in the times of pandemic has developed the most dangerous conspiracy theory about the COVID-19. The group thought that the pandemic was something to celebrate cover for the secret arrest of the Deep State elites by Trump’s administration. Up until March 23, when Q posted a theory that coronavirus was developed with the joint venture of China and democrats to stop Trump’s reelection by destroying the economy. In other instances, QAnon launched #FilmYourHospital to charge into the hospital and look for sick patients and cars in the garage to uncover the tactic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FBI claimed these conspiracy theories by QAnon are “potential domestic terrorism threat”. Infodemic should be regulated and controlled otherwise it would be a threat to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. I wonder if there is a similar group in India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 013, Birdie Study</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1989, Japan’s Shinkansen Bullet Trains were tendered to go faster but they had a problem. They were fast but every time it exited a tunnel — it was loud. The noise was coming from a variety of sources. Whenever a train sped through the tunnel it compressed the air and pushed it through the other end creating a sonic boom. These deafening waves could be heard uptil 400 meters. An engineering team was set up to design quieter, faster and more efficient trains. Eiji Nakatsu, General Manager of the Technical Development Department, also a birdwatcher, led the team to redesign trains based on the aerodynamics of 3 birds — Owl, Penguin and Kingfisher. Nakatsu remodeled the pantograph by getting inspired from the owl’s feathers, reducing noise by using the same curvatures and indents. The Adelie Penguin whose body allows them to swim and slide effortlessly helped in restructuring the shaft of the pantograph. And most notable of all, the kingfisher’s beak inspired the train nose model. When the redesigned train was first run, it was 10% faster, used 15% less electricity and stayed under 70 dB noise limit in residential areas. Birds, the world’s best engineers, teaches us a lot about avian efficiency and redesigning principles of aircrafts and other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V-shaped Flying pattern&lt;/strong&gt;
There is a good reason some birds fly in a V. As birds flap, it creates a vortex of air which creates lift for trailing birds. Which means the bird can fly longer without getting tired. This is often considered as surfing, inspiring engineers to develop strategies to conserve fuel in aircrafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bird Head Stabilization&lt;/strong&gt;
With a large number of vertebrae and muscles in their neck, birds can hold their head in a position even when their body is moving. This helps birds to focus on the predator and maneuver through complex terrains. By keeping their head stable, birds don’t have to rely alone on their eyes for image stabilization. Although Gaze Stabilization is complex and poorly understood, it has inspired modern steadicam technologies — Gimbal, Camera Stabilizer. As we will understand more about stabilization, we can develop better models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Woodpecker and Shock Absorption&lt;/strong&gt;
Woodpeckers spiral through the tree trunks in search of insects. They peck at upto 20 times per second and create a force almost 10 times greater than what would cause concussion to humans. How do they do it? Scientists have discovered that a certain portion of their skull is soft and shock absorbent, which allows them to bear the energy they produce. Researchers are set out to develop artificial analogues to build mechanical shock absorbing systems to protect microelectronics. Also, these shock absorbing systems can protect spacecraft from the damage of collisions with small meteorites and space debris. Furthermore, sports equipment with shock absorbent property would be of incredible use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the lightweight interlaced mesh of feathers which have enabled birds to conquer gravity and take air in an extraordinary way; energy efficient Eagle’s Talon to pluck the prey, hovering technique of Hummingbird etc will help us develop and optimize technologies by biomimicking birds. Birdwatching can lead us to achieve modern marvels.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 012, Cave Painting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Chauvet-Pont-d’Arc Caves, in Southeast France, are one of the most important prehistoric sites ever discovered. Although these artworks were designed 35000 years ago but the animals drawn on the cave are considered to be masterpieces.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cavePainting.jpg&quot; height=&quot;80%&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rhinoceros Alcove in Chauvet-Pont-d’Arc Cave, France&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cave art depicting groups of rhinos, humans hunting boar and buffaloes, human-animal hybrid etc are nearly 44,000 years old, making it one of the earliest known cave paintings by humans. Cave Paintings are pictorial records of storytelling and figurative art. The seeds of artistic creativity were sown as early as 65,000 years ago by Neanderthals (subspecies of Archaic Human) in Spain. It flourished in Europe where it burst and came into full fledged view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most common subjects of these cave doodles were wild animals — bison, horses, auroch, deer, human figures and symbolic art. They were developed using organic and inorganic pigments — red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide, charcoal etc. To further accentuate the features of the animals, artists used natural contours of the walls. These symbolic and religious paintings are believed to be drawn by Shamans, who went deep inside the cave to perform ceremonial trance and drew their spirit animals. 
These faded yet stark and evocative designs tell us about the distant past and provide us with the evidence of time. More precisely, it tells us about human evolution. Cave Painters weren’t just Picasso, drawing impressions on the walls. Rather, they had  high-level cognitive processing to develop a communication system. Moreover, these cave graffiti tells us about the features of animals of that time, extinct animals and animals who have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation that drove cave artists might be a mystery but the treasure it possesses to the contemporary world is immense.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 011, Today: A Lazy Day</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After my &lt;a href=&quot;https://square-1111.github.io/2020/Battle-of-laziest/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; on laziness, I decided to take a day off, Because - Why not? And believe me, it was a great day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 10 o’clock in the morning when I snoozed my alarm for the last time, not because I didn’t want to sleep more but ma had different plans. She loves me so much that she came with a rolling pin (belan). I got overwhelmed by her love and woke up. I was about to step down from the bed, a thought popped “Today is a lazy day, Why don’t you stew in your filth for some more time” and it was a life changing decision. Lazily I picked up my phone and scrolled the devils plunger — Reddit for an hour. Bored! I slept for another hour. Waking up, I gathered some strength to get my laptop which was 3 ft away resting on the table. I consumed some of the weirdest content on YouTube. Finally, I decided to leave the bed after receiving Google Classroom’s notification. Assignment! Uh Huh, I also second it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my chores, I decided to write my assignment. Wait a minute! Were there any tasks on schedule? Caught me! Nah there weren’t any. I had zero idea about the subject, but who needs it when I have gracious friends around me. With every page I wrote I wandered something bizarre — What if our eyes popped out from the socket abruptly? More ideas provoked as I finished the assignment. Next, I performed the dark art of fat loss and right after it, I had 3 rasgullas. Those rasgullas made me so sleepy that I dozed off for some more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing I remember - I woke up for dinner and this made my mom think that I had smoked weed. While watching another episode of FRIENDS for the gazillionth time, I had dinner. Film rolled and I binged episode after episode of FRIENDS. &lt;strong&gt;11:30 PM&lt;/strong&gt; and I had not yet decided what to write about. That’s when my friend suggested writing about today. Finally, after such a tiring day, I gathered all my courage to post this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been one really happy day but I might go insane if I follow it more often. Now, if you will please let me snore again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Bye. Peace out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 010, Battle of Laziest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sloth vs Koala — These two might make you super sleepy. Don’t take out your pillows just yet. Instead, grab a coffee. Don’t worry, you ain’t gonna miss anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sloths are low energy loafers, inhabitant to Central and South America. These are drowsy tree-dwellers who sleep 15 hours a day and barely move even when awake. They are so snail-paced that they grow algae on their skin, it makes them less noticeable to predators. If you groom Sloths, thousands of moths might fly out. In fact, when they groom themselves, they move their fingers so slow that the moths have no difficulty keeping up with the pace. Once every week, they come down to defecate and cover their poop with leaves. While on ground, they move slowly by digging their front claws into the dirt and dragging their bodies. Despite the fact that they don’t do much, sloth has a constant smile on the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next contestant is Koala. Often known as Koala-bear, it is barely related to the bear family, instead Koala belongs to Marsupials family. These sleepy-headed creatures doze off for 18 hrs a day. Found in Australia, these convenient eaters hardly leave the Eucalyptus tree where they get endless supply of their favorite food — Eucalyptus leaves. This means less time searching for food  and more time for snoring. Koalas might not be the smartest animal but they are cute, cuddly and extremely photogenic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does it mean laziness contributes to happiness? :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these beings are either sleeping or daydreaming. But who is the winner? Umm, None. But &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/proishan11&quot;&gt;Ishan Singh&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of mine with a weird hairdo. He has achieved new heights of laziness in this lockdown. He hasn’t left the sofa in a while and has developed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissencephaly&quot;&gt;smooth brain&lt;/a&gt;. Reaching this new feat of idleness, sloth and koala are no competition to him. As a matter of fact, he has moved beyond the illusions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, get back to your fast paced schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS. Sadly, earlier this year many Koalas were killed because of Australian Fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;PS2. Thank You &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/proishan11&quot;&gt;Ishan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 009, Dark Matter and Dark Energy : the holding forces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever Since the Big Bang, our Universe is expanding and reaching new feat. If gravity was playing its role, the universe would have collapsed. Also, gravity cannot explain the high rotation speed of the galaxies. Either the gravity behaves in an odd fashion or there might be some matter in the Universe that holds everything together while the Universe is expanding. Indeed there exists a substance termed as Dark Matter. Dark matter is the most mysterious yet ubiquitous substance in the Universe. Our Universe has around 68% dark energy, 37% Dark Matter. The rest 5% is everything on Earth, everything ever observed by instruments and all normal material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I feel so tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the 5 basic elements — Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth — of the material world, Dark Matter could not be seen, felt, smelt or tasted. In fact, It does not even interact with electromagnetic waves. This means it does not absorb, reflect or emit light, making it more difficult to spot. Researchers have seen some potential interaction with gravitational forces. What is it? As of now, we know more about what it isn’t than what it is. Dark Matter isn’t anti matter, otherwise it would have produced gamma rays when annihilated with normal matter. Neither is it a black hole, or failed stars or clouds of gas or anything else that can be made from normal matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations are trying to figure out its presence to understand more about the Universe. Scientists have installed sensitive sensors under the Earth to see if Dark Matter interacts with classical elements. Similarly, Satellites, through a special Gamma Ray Telescope, traces the energy imprints of dark matter collision. Moreover, at CERN, researches are smashing normal particles together inside the Large Hadron Collider just to check if there is subsequent change in the property of the material inside. Although the results aren’t successful, we understand more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several theories explaining dark matter. Albert Einstein first explained it as the property of the space, suggesting empty space is not nothing. Later, in one version of Einstein’s gravity theory, he proposed a cosmological constant. Through cosmological constant, he predicted that “empty space” can possess its own energy and would not be diluted. As more space comes, more energy will be generated. This defines the ever expanding nature of the Universe. No one actually understood why cosmological constant is even there. Another theory, derived from Quantum theory of matter, proposed that empty space is made of virtual particles that continually form and disappear. But using this theory, when the energy of dark matter was calculated, it was wrong by an order of 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;. There are other incomplete theories which, at the end, lead to nothing. So, the mystery remains unrevealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Matter is a mystery that we want to understand. Demystifying it would be a key to a whole new understanding of physics.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Dark Matter matters!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Day 008, Being One</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t overthink, there is nothing whimsical, scary, poetic, it’s just a post about number one. No no no, not about number one but about NUMBER 1. Ugh! It’s just too hard. Nevermind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One is the loneliest number” is not just a song but a truth in the world of Mathematics. 1 is no fun to play with. Multiplying and dividing by one is so underwhelming. Mathematically, it is called “unity” and it has even more strange properties — the square root of one is one. With all this unlikeliness, one wasn’t even considered as a number for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aristotle, Euclid and many of the founding fathers of Mathematics did not consider one as a number. Why? They reasoned that the number is “multitude composed of units”. Under this definition, one is not a number but the seed for a number. And I used to feel I am a sufferer of FOMO. But this isn’t the end. In Contemporary world, when one is considered as a number there are other hustles. Historically, One has been on and off the hook of prime numbers list. With all the properties of being a prime, mathematicians suggested one does not preserve the uniqueness of the factorization. Finally, The fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that “Every positive integer can be represented as the product of prime numbers.” suggested the world of mathematics to exclude one from the definition of prime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\[6 = 2\times 3\]
\[6 = 3\times 2\]
\[6 = 1\times 2 \times 3\]
\[6 = 1\times 1\times 2 \times 3\]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two are unique factorization but latter two aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;center&gt;One is the loneliest number you will ever do.&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might be the loneliest number but one was never the loser. It has overpowered the world of technology along with zero —  binary notation. No number can be formed without the approval of one. In Grandi’s series when one was added and subtracted infinitely to add up to \(\frac{1}{2}\), made one quite confused about its existence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\[S = 1-1+1-1+1-1+…\]
\[1-S = 1 - (1-1+1-1…..) = S\]
\[1-S = S\]
\[S = \frac{1}{2}\]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One” might as well have its own problems, but it is ruling the world with peace. Next time you feel low or anxious or sad, think about the struggles of one — From not even getting considered as a number to being one.&lt;/p&gt;
